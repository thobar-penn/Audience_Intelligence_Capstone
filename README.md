# Audience Intelligence Capstone

This repository contains the final version of my Audience Intelligence Capstone project. All notebooks included here have been carefully reviewed and masked to ensure that **no sensitive enterprise data, customer information, internal identifiers, or proprietary attributes** are exposed.

## Data Masking & Privacy Notes

- All **policy-level**, **customer-level**, and **geographic fields** containing sensitive or regulated information have been removed, tokenized, or replaced with non-identifying values.
- Any **internal codes, reference tables, or lookup mappings** used within the enterprise dataset have been stripped out or substituted with anonymized placeholders.
- **Distributional characteristics** and **feature engineering logic** have been preserved so that model development, feature selection, and methodology remain representative of the real project.
- No protected or proprietary business logic—such as **rating algorithms**, **underwriting rules**, or **confidential KPIs**—is included.
- All notebooks are intended for **academic demonstration purposes only** and do **not** reflect real enterprise data products, customers, or operational decisions.
